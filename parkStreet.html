    <p class="container">Park Street, officially known as Mother Teresa Sarani, is a famous thoroughfare in the city of Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), India. The street runs through what was a deer park of Sir Elijah Impey, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in Calcutta
      from 1773 to 1789, hence the earlier name. Its current official name was given by Kolkata Municipal Corporation in honour of Mother Teresa. </p>

    <h4 class="change">History</h4>
    <p class="change">Documented records of the throughfare can be traced back to 1760, when Kolkata (then Calcutta) was the capital of the British Empire in India. Since 1760, the street has been through several name changes. Previous names include 'Ghorustan ka
      Rasta', Vansittart Avenue and Burial Ground Road.<br>

      Some 250 years ago, Park Street was known as Burial Ground Road and was not a preferred choice of residence, as there were a number of cemeteries in this area, the South Park Street Cemetery, opposite to it was the North Park Street Cemetery
      (now replaced by a school). Further west, there were two smaller cemeteries, one French and one Italian (now replaced by offices and schools).<br>

      Park Street has been the main evening recreation zone for Kolkata people since the British era. In the 1970s and 1980s much of Kolkata's night life took place in Park Street, with many clubs and restaurants situated there. Many noted musicians
      had played at various popular night spots, such as Trinca's, Peter Cat, Oly Pub, Blue Fox, Mocambo and Moulin Rouge. Even before that, from the 1940s through to the late 1960s, Kolkata's prolific night life was centred on fashionable Park
      Street. The Park Hotel chain started with the opening of its first hotel, the 150 room The Park Hotel on 1 November 1967. The park street name coinage is assumed to be having association with such a history. </p><br>

    <h4>Location and Importance</h4>
    <p class="container">Park Street originates from Chowringhee Road (J L Nehru Road) and connects to Park Circus 7 point crossing in a south eastern direction. The portion of Park Street between Chowringhee Road and Mullick Bazar has been one of the city's
      attractions for years. Several important roads originate from/intersect at Park Street in the northward and southward directions, namely Russell Street, Middleton Row, Camac Street, Wood Street, Loudon Street and Rawdon Street towards the South
      and Free School Street, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road towards the North. Park Street also intersects AJC Bose Road at Mullick Bazar crossing and eventually goes to Park Circus from where other major roads such as Syed Amir Ali Avenue, Darga Road, Park
      Circus Connector starts and connects to important areas such as Ballygunge, EM Bypass and CIT Road.<br>

      Park Street remains Kolkata's foremost dining district, with many restaurants and pubs. It is often known as "Food Street" and "The Street that Never Sleeps". In the last 15 years, many new restaurants, shopping malls, 5-star hotels and
      nightclubs have opened in other areas of the city and hence Park Street has lost much of its earlier attraction as being the numero uno entertainment hub of Kolkata. However, it is still one of the prime commercial and entertainment zones of
      the city. Park Street is traditionally decorated with lights on Diwali, Christmas Day and New Year's Eve. </p>
