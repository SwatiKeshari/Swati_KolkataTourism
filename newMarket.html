    <p class="container">New Market is a market in Kolkata situated on Lindsay Street, beside Free School Street (Mirza Ghalib Street/Rani Rasmoni Road). Although primarily "New Market" referred to the original enclosed market, today in local
      parlance, the entire shopping area is often known as "New Market". </p>

    <h4 class="change">History</h4>
    <p class="change">Some of the earliest English quarters of Calcutta were in an area known then as Dalhousie Square. Terretti and Lalbazar nearby were the customary shopping haunts of the British. Later settlements arose in Kashaitola, Dharmatala
      and Chowringhee. By the 1850s, British colonists held sway in Calcutta and displayed increasing contempt for the "natives" and an aversion to brushing shoulders with them at the bazaars. In 1871, moved by a well orchestrated outcry from English
      residents, a committee of the Calcutta Corporation began to contemplate a market which would be the preserve of Calcutta's British residents. Spurred by the committee's deliberations, the Corporation purchased Lindsay Street, made plans to raze
      the old Fenwick's Bazar located there, and commissioned Richard Roskell Bayne, an architect of the East Indian Railway Company, to design the Victorian Gothic market complex which would take its place. It began to take shape in 1873, and Bayne
      was honoured for his achievement with a Rs. 1,000 rupee award, a large sum in the 1870s. Mackintosh Burn was the builder.<br>

      The giant shopping arcade was thrown open to the English populace with some fanfare on 1 January 1874. News of Calcutta's first municipal market spread rapidly. Affluent colonials from all over India shopped at exclusive retailers like Ranken
      and Company (dressmakers), Cuthbertson and Harper (shoe-merchants) and R.W. Newman or Thacker Spink, the famous stationers and book-dealers.</p>


    <h4 class="change">Description</h4>
    <p class="container">Despite the appearance of new air-conditioned, American-style, shopping malls all over Kolkata, New Market, which has survived two devastating fires and regular flooding, remains at the core of the shopping experience in the
      city. Over 2000 stalls under its roof sell everything from clothing to wheeled luggage to electronics to a special cheese found nowhere else. Under its apparent chaos lie extraordinary finds as well as remarkable bargains. Newmarket is a place
      to shop for garments & accessories, flowers, different food items including raw meat, fish, vegetables and fruits and even spices. There are crockeries and utensil stores. It also has a florist section dealing with exotic flowers. It is
      situated on Lindsay Street, Kolkata (Calcutta), just off Chowringhee Road, the market is open 10 a.m. until 8 p.m. Monday to Friday, until 7 p.m. on Saturdays, and closed on Sundays. </p>

    <h4>Food Stores</h4>
    <p class="container">There are several renowned confectioners in New Market: Nahoum & Sons (estd. 1902) is truly historic, with its original mahogany cabinetry and marble counters. For over a century, millions of customers have sworn by Nahoum's
      Rich Fruit Cake, its brownies, marzipan, macaroons and much more. Imperial Confectioners and D Gama compete for a close second and third place.<br>

      Kalimpong Cheese and Bandel Cheese are local cheese available only in New Market. Kalimpong Cheese comes from the North Bengal tourist spot of Kalimpong, it can be crumbled into salad or eaten raw. Bandel Cheese is an Asian cheese originated in
      an erstwhile Portuguese colony, Bandel located in eastern India. It is an indigenous unripened, salted soft variety of cheese made in perforated pots. It is similar to Surti paneer but made from cow's milk. Available in two varieties, plain
      (white) and smoked (brown). Bandel cheese is well salted and can be stored.</p><br><br><br>
